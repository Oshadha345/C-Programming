# üß† C Programming: Deep Dive From Bits to Systems

Welcome to the Miracle C Programming Course ‚Äî custom-built for a system-savvy, architecture-curious engineering mind. This repository will guide you from basic syntax all the way to memory-level mastery and systems programming.

---

## üß≠ Course Goals

- üöÄ Master C from both a programmer‚Äôs and an engineer‚Äôs perspective.
- üî¨ Understand memory, stack, heap, and system calls in depth.
- üß± Build projects that bridge theory (digital design, low-level systems) with practical coding.
- üîß Prepare for embedded systems, OS-level development, and hardware interfacing.

## üß† This Repo is For You If...

- You care how systems work under the hood.
- You enjoy digital logic and want to bridge it with code.
- You want to build smarter C programs, not just functional ones.
- You believe every line of code should be memory-aware.

---

## üìå Milestone Goals

- [ ] Finish all mini-projects
- [ ] Write a 4-layer TCP/IP simulator in C
- [ ] Build your own malloc
- [ ] Submit an embedded project (e.g., ESP32 or STM32-based)
- [ ] Teach a topic to someone else
